# Alz-Prod
An Android app that utilizes Microsoft Azure Face API and Google Map API to support people with Alzheimer's to maintain memories of loved ones and stay safe.

## Description
15 million American's have Alzheimer's disease. 
Our Android app is a personalized assistant for these individuals, allowing them to maintain their memory in the short and long-term with additional features for safety. 

We understand that Alzheimer's patients experience personal frustration when they fail to recognize loved ones. 
We used Azure's Face API to help with this. To increase safety, we used the Google Map API with pre-set home location, with one click, 
they will be shown the way home.

#### Our primary goal is to provide enable individuals, with Alzheimer's, with what they need to become more integrated in society.
